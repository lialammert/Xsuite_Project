Coupling and Beam-beam Effects on Luminosity - Specialisation Semester CERN / EPFL LPAP

Abstract from report : 
"The interplay between linear coupling and beam-beam effects significantly influences luminosity in particle accelerators like the LHC. This report investigates their combined impact using simulations of a simplified LHC lattice using the Xsuite beam dynamics framework, with a particular focus on local coupling scenarios. Exploring various parameters and situations demonstrates how coupling modifies beam dynamics, impacting luminosity and its calibration via van der Meer (vdM) scans. Results from this preliminary study highlights that stronger coupling alter luminosity profiles and this counteracts the beam-beam effects, particularly at high beam separations. These insights enhance our understanding of correcting coupling effects for improved collider performance."
